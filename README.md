## OrderPick
A basic order picking tool to record the weighted prices of items in an order and calculate the refund that is required.

Groceries have to deal with weighted items like meat or prepared foods that are made in house and weighed at purchase. For example a steak that is 1.12 kg and priced at $30 per kg. One way to deal with this in Shopify is to add a $10-$30 Refundable Credit Card Hold product to each cart and then once the steak is weighed, we can refund the Refundable Hold minus the value of the overweight product.
